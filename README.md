# Lexic-SintacticAnalizer

The lexical-syntactic analysis aims to recognize the form of the sentences of a language. Recognizing the form of a sentence implies recognizing its lexemes and syntactic structures. The result of the lexical-syntactic analysis can be a recognition error or a version of the sentence recognized in the form of an abstract syntax tree (handle).
